  - vendor

# All the files to copy to the remote system on deploy. These could contain config files.

# project_local_files:
#   - name: "some_file"           // <- optional, for your own reference and readability
#     src: "local-path-to-file"   // <- relative or absolute, just like Ansible

# The shared_children is a list of all files/folders in your project that need to be linked to a path in "/shared".
# For example a sessions directory or an uploads folder. They are created if they don't exist, with the type
# specified in the `type` key (file or directory).
# Example:
# project_shared_children:
#   - path: "app/sessions"
#     src: "sessions"
#     mode: "0755"
#     type: "file" / "directory"  // <- optional, defaults to "directory"

# The project_environment is a list of environment variables added to the various *_commands
# Example:
# project_environment:
#   WP_ENV: "production"

# There are a few moments in this role where arbitrary command(s) can be run. These commands receive
# the "project_environment" so deploys for different stages can be done by changing this.
# Each command is a dict with a `cmd` and an optional `path`. The `path` is relative to the
# local Trellis directory (for `project_pre_build_commands_local`) or relative to the
# `new_release_path` on the remote server (for `project_pre_build_commands` and `project_post_build_commands`).
# Examples:
# project_pre_build_commands_local:
#   - path: "{{ project.local_path }}/web/app/themes/sage"
#     cmd: gulp --production
# project_post_build_commands:
#   - path: web/app/themes/mytheme
#     cmd: npm install && gulp --production
#   - cmd: wp db import posts.sql

# - file: path="{{ deploy.new_release_path }}/{{ deploy.unfinished_filename }}" state=absent
