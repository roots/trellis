# The shared_children is a list of all files/folders in your project that need to be linked to a path in `/shared`.
# For example a sessions directory or an uploads folder. They are created if they don't exist, with the type
# specified in the `type` key (file or directory).
# Example:
# project_shared_children:
#   - path: app/sessions
#     src: sessions
#     mode: '0755'      // <- optional, use an octal number starting with 0 or quote it, defaults to `'0755'` if `directory` or `'0644'` if `file`
#     type: directory // <- optional, defaults to `directory`, options: `directory` or `file`
